									<h2>Day 15: Valuation <h2>
									</header>

									</p>
										Today I tried digging into valuation, this is the art/science of figuring out if a stock is 
		    undervalued, fairly valued, or overvalued. This is by comparing the price of the stock to what that 
		    company is actually earning or expected to earn. It all depends on how the price compares to what
		    the company is actually giving and how worth it it is
									</p>
									<section>
										<header>
											<h3>What I Practiced</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											I went into Finbox and plugged in some companies like Microsoft and Intel so that I could look at
											their valuations. I then used Finviz to filter for stocks with PEG ratios under 1.5 and P/E ratios
											between 10 - 25 so that I could find undervalued stocks.
										<p>
									</section>
									<section>
										<header>
											<h3>What I learned:</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											Some key valuation metrics and tools I learned include: P/E Ratio (The price of the stock
						          usually means that the stock is "liquid" or that lots of people are trading it. A wide spread (like 
                      $7.00 - $7.50) means that there are fewer buyers and sellers. Liquidity = how easy is to get a trade done.
                      If your stock is highly liquid, it means that the stock is easy to buy and sell quickly while a lower 
                      liquidity means that it might take longer to find someone to trade with and you might also lose money on
                      the spread.

										<h2>Day 2: All about Volume</h2>
										</header> 
										<p>
                     Something that I thought I could talk about after looking at a stock chart is volume (those vertical bars 
                     at the bottom of charts) Volume is the number of shares traded during a certain time period (say 1 day)
                     The real reason however why volume is so important however is because it shows how much interest there 
                     is in a stock. 
								   	</p>
										<section>
											<header>
												<h3>Why it matters</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												If a stock has high volume, it means that lots of people are trading the stock and its popular. Low 
                        volume is not good, It means that pretty much no one is trading it; if it still moves then it might
                        be fake so that beginner investors like us would invest into it. If the volume of a particular stock
                        is spiking, that means something important has happened such as news dropping or big traders getting 
                        involved.
											<p>
										</section>
										<section>
											<header>
												<h3>How to use Volume:</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												Learning how to read volume can help you read the market and make better decisions. One thing that I 
											  really useful was the Wyckodd Method. It uses volume to track what big investors are doing behind the scenes.
										          There are 4 market phases that I learned that should be helpful in figuring out how stocks move. During 
										          accumulation, volume starts spiking when the stock is down that shows panic selling while smart investors
                                                                                          are buying when the price is low. In markup, breakouts with strong volume confirm the trend. In distribution,
											  unpredictable movment and volume often shows that big investors are selling into the hype. Lastly, during 
											  markdown, volume surges on drop show that people are having fear and they are exiting. Overall, Wyckoff
											  believed that you could use volume to figure out what the top investors are doing.

										<h2>Day 3: Market Structure </h2>
										</header> 
										<p>
                     If we want to invest in the stock market, I thought it would be best to learn about how the market
		     works itself and the best way to do that is to learn about market structure. At its core, market
		     structure is about identifying whether a stock is going/trending up (bullish), down (barrish) or
		     moving sideways (consolidation). If the stock is in an uptrend, the price forms higher highs and 
		     higher lows. If the stock is in a downtrend, the price is in lower highs and lower lows. Support
		     is the price level where buyers tend to step in and push the price up. Alternatively, Resistance
		     is the price level where sellers step in and push the price down. One cool trick I learned is to
		     look left on a chart and see the previous turning points -- those often become the future support
		     or resistance level.
                                                                                </p>

												<h3>What I Practiced</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												I am trying out a new method of sharing information which is to tell you what I practiced and what I 
												learned from it. Here is what I did: I picked a few high performing stocks like Apple, Microsoft, etc.
												and I drew out their recent highs and lows. I used that to find and identify trends using basic price 
												action (analyzing basic price movement over time). I marked areas where the price has bounced or 
												changed multiple times (support) or where it was rejected (resistance)
											<p>
										</section>
										<section>
											<header>
												<h3>What I learned</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												 I learned that understanding market structure gives you context for everything. It makes volume and 
												 price action more meaningful because you get to see how buyers and sellers figher over certain price
												 zones and it shows how a stock grows over time. You can even use it to see if you should even be 
												 trading or not depending on the state of the market. 
                                                                                        </p>

											<h2>Day 4: Chart Patterns </h2>
										</header> 
										<p>
                     Now that I know about how the market is structured, I think learning chart patterns and learning
		     how to anticipate potential moves is the best way forward. Chart patterns are repeated shapes 
		     show up when you use price action and it often shows what will happen next in the chart. 
                     These patterns are important because they reflect the psychology of buyers and sellers. Some
		     Some patterns signal that the trend is likely to continue while others suggest that the trend
		     will flip. Some continuation patterns include: Bull Flag (A sharp move up followed by a tight,
		     downward sloping-line moving sideways), Pennant (Price moves sideways into a small symmetrical
		     triangle after a strong move), and Ascending Triangle (Flat resistance at the rop with higher
		     lows forming underneath). Some reversal patterns include Double Top (Price hits the same high 
	             but fails to break through), Head and Shoulders (Three peaks with the middle one being the 
		     highest), and Cup and Handle (Rounded bottom followed by a small dip).
                                                                                </p>
										</section>
										<section>
											<header>
												<h3>What I Practiced</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												So what I did was I scanned a few ETFs and stocks on TradingView and I started marking them to find any 
												patterns that I recognized. I started with bull flags and double tops and made my way to the other 
												patterns. I also checked to see if volume confirmed the pattern. 
											<p>
										</section>
										<section>
											<header>
												<h3>What I learned</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												 I learned that chart patterns dont guarantee anything but they give struture to where breakouts or 
												 breakdowns might occur. Combining this with understanding market strcture (Day 3) and volume (Day 2)
												 can make this so much more powerful. Think of this as a map for how prices might move next.
                                                                                        </p>

											<h2>Day 5: Candlesticks </h2>
										</header> 
										<p>
                     Sticking to charts, I just learned about candlestick patterns. These are the small, simple 
		     shapes on a chart that tell you how the prices were during a specific time frame (say 1 hour).
		     Each candle shows 4 main things: the opening price, the closing price, and the highs/lows 
		     during that period. Green candles signal that the price closed higher than it opened but red
		     candles means that it closer lower. How the candle looks reveals the battle between the buyers
		     sellers. Key single-candle signals include Hammer (Small body with a long lower wick after a 
		     downtrend -often bullish), Shooting Star (Small body with a long upper wick after a uptrend
		     -- often bearish), and Doji (The open and close are nearly the same --shows indecision). Some
		     Some important multi-candle patterns include Bullish Engulfing (A small red candle followed by
		     a large green candle --shows buyers taking control), Bearish Engulfing (Opposite of Bullish),
		     Morning star (Red candle, then a small candle followed by a big green candle --often seem at 
		     bottoms, and then Evening Star (Same idea but in reverse, often seen at tops).
                                                                                </p>
										</section>
										<section>
											<header>
												<h3>What I Practiced</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												I looked at a couple charts and I studied how candlestick patterns formed near key support and  
												resistance zones. I saw how context matters in these situations though as a bullish engulfing
												at resistance is not as useful at one at support, etc. 
											<p>
										</section>
										<section>
											<header>
												<h3>What I learned</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												 I learned that candlesticks can be pretty powerful. It helped me zoom in and see how emotions play  
												 in the minds of buyers and sellers. Some emotions that are mainly seen include panic,greed, 
												 hesitation, and strength. 
                                                                                        </p>

											<h2>Day 6: Moving Averages </h2>
										</header> 
										<p>
                     Today, I learned about how moving averages can help me spot trends and make better 
		     decision by giving clarity on a stocks price. A moving average (MA) shows the average
		     price over a certain number of periods (like 10, 20, 50 days). It cant really predict
		     the future but it will help confirm what is happening currently. There are two types
		     of MA. The Simple Moving Average (SMA) is just the avergae of the closing prices over
		     a certain number of days. The 50 day and 200 day ones are the most popular. The other
		     type is Exponential Moving Average (EMA), this is similar to SMA but it gives more
		     weight to recent prices so it reacts faster. This is mainly used for short term trading.
                                                                                </p>
										</section>
										<section>
											<header>
												<h3>What I Practiced</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												All I did was pick some charts and use different SMA's and EMA's on the chart to see how it works.  
												I mainly used the 9 EMA, 21 EMA, and the 200 SMA. I noticed many things like good entry points and
												upturns.
											<p>
										</section>
										<section>
											<header>
												<h3>What I learned</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												 I learned that moving averages lag behind price but they are incredibly helpful in confirming  
												 trends, identifying different price zones and even timing entries. They also make it easier to 
												 trades longer by giving structures and they work really well with volume and candlesticks.
                                                                                        </p>

											<h2>Day 7: Relative Strength Index </h2>
										</header> 
										<p>
                     Relative Strength Index, or RSI is a momentum indicator that tells you how strong a 
		     price move is and whether a stock might have been overbought or oversold. RSI is a 
		     number between 0 and 100 and its usually plotted under a stock chart. The most
		     common settings use a 14-period average (thats the past 14 days on a daily chart).
		     To read RSI, you use the numbers. An RSI above 70 means that the stock was overbought
		     (the price rose up too fast). An RSI below 30 indicates the stock was oversold. An 
		     RSI between 40 - 60 shows the neutral zone and is often seen in consolidating markets.
                                                                                </p>
										</section>
										<section>
											<header>
												<h3>What I Practiced</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												I looked at a few stocks and ETFs and noted how the stock responded to extreme RSIs, neutral
												RSIS and also how the stock responded in support/resistance zones.
											<p>
										</section>
										<section>
											<header>
												<h3>What I learned</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												 I learned that when the RSI is above 70 and price was near resistance, it often pulled back but
												 when the RSI dropped below 30, there were reversal candles signaling a bounce. I also learned 
												 about RSI divergence which is that when price makes a new high but the RSI doesn't, it often signals
												 weakening momentum.
                                                                                        </p>
