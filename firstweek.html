									<h2>Day 1: What even is the stock market?</h2>
									</header>

									<p>
										I thought that before I start learning about how to go into the stock market, I should know what the
										stock market even is. After much research, I have learned that the stock market exists primarily so 
										companies can earn capital and funding but it also provides investors with the chance to get in on 
										some of the profits that the certain company makes if it becomes successful. This can have a negative
										effect though if you buy into the wrong company. To sum it up, It is essentially a marketplace where buyers and 
										sellers can exchange shares of publicily traded companies.
									</p>

											<h3>Supply and Demand</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											Supply and Demand plays a huge role in whether a stock is successful or not. If more people want to 
											buy a stock of a company (say its a new popular startup) than sell it, then the price will move up. 
											Conversely, if more people want to sell the stock then buy it, the prices will go down. This will
											affect how much your stocks value increases or decreases after your investment.
										<p>
									</section>

											<h3>Ownership</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											When you buy a stock, you are pretty much becoming a shareholder which gives you a stake in its assets
											and even its profits (this is where you get dividends from). There are two types of stocks. The first 
											type is Common stock. Common stocks as the name suggests are the most common type of stock. One cool
											benefit from this type of stock though is that you get voting rights to elect the board of directors 
											at the company you buy into. You get one vote per share so your voting power increases the more 
											stocks you buy. The second type however is Preferred Stock. Preferred Stocks dont offer voting 
											rights and they may have a fixed dividend (Common stocks have variable dividends that increase or
											decrease depending on the value of the stock). Preferred stocks also usually offer a fixed dividend
											which would be a more stable investment while variable dividends could go wrong if your company starts 
											losing money.
