									<h2>Day 1: The Start of My 30-Day Journey <h2>
									</header>

									</p>
										Welcome to my journey. For the next 30 days, I will be diving into the world of the stock market as a 
                    complete beginner that wants to know how this works. I already know the basics: stocks represent 
                    ownership in a company, prices go up and down, and the main philosophy is to "buy low, sell high". But 
                    there is actually a large difference between knowing what the stock market is and actualy understanding
                    how to participate in it.
                    
                    Thats what this project is about.
               
                    Each day, I will explore a key concept - something that actally matters. I'm not here to give you generic
                    tips and AI course seller slop but actually give you good adivce and learn them myself too. I want to figure
                    out what works and what doesn't. Everything I learn, I will explain in simple, easy to understand terms right
                    here. 
									</p>
									<section>

											<h3>How do Stock Prices Move?</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											I started this off by learning how stock prices move. The first thing I learned was the order book. 
											The order book is a list of buy orders (bids) and sell orders (asks) for a stock. A bid is how much
                      someone is willing to pay to buy a share. An ask is how much someone wants to sell a share for. You 
                      can only trade if both the buyer and the seller agree on a price. Lets say if someone is asking to
                      sell the stock for $12.50 but the highest big is $12.00, the stock wont move until both of them can
                      agree on a price. This is important to learn so that you can make better decisions overall. 
										<p>
									</section>
									<section>
										<header>
											<h3>Bid/Ask Spread and Liquidity</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											The bid/ask spread is the gap between the highest bid and the lowest ask. A tight spread (like $7.50/7.51)
						          usually means that the stock is "liquid" or that lots of people are trading it. A wide spread (like 
                      $7.00 - $7.50) means that there are fewer buyers and sellers. Liquidity = how easy is to get a trade done.
                      If your stock is highly liquid, it means that the stock is easy to buy and sell quickly while a lower 
                      liquidity means that it might take longer to find someone to trade with and you might also lose money on
                      the spread.

										<h2>Day 2: All about Volume</h2>
										</header> 
										<p>
                     Something that I thought I could talk about after looking at a stock chart is volume (those vertical bars 
                     at the bottom of charts) Volume is the number of shares traded during a certain time period (say 1 day)
                     The real reason however why volume is so important however is because it shows how much interest there 
                     is in a stock. 
								   	</p>
										<section>
											<header>
												<h3>Why it matters</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												If a stock has high volume, it means that lots of people are trading the stock and its popular. Low 
                        volume is not good, It means that pretty much no one is trading it; if it still moves then it might
                        be fake so that beginner investors like us would invest into it. If the volume of a particular stock
                        is spiking, that means something important has happened such as news dropping or big traders getting 
                        involved.
											<p>
										</section>
										<section>
											<header>
												<h3>How to use Volume:</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												Learning how to read volume can help you read the market and make better decisions. One thing that I 
											  really useful was the Wyckodd Method. It uses volume to track what big investors are doing behind the scenes.
										          There are 4 market phases that I learned that should be helpful in figuring out how stocks move. During 
										          accumulation, volume starts spiking when the stock is down that shows panic selling while smart investors
                                                                                          are buying when the price is low. In markup, breakouts with strong volume confirm the trend. In distribution,
											  unpredictable movment and volume often shows that big investors are selling into the hype. Lastly, during 
											  markdown, volume surges on drop show that people are having fear and they are exiting. Overall, Wyckoff
											  believed that you could use volume to figure out what the top investors are doing. 
                      </p>

										<h2>Day 3: Market Structure </h2>
										</header> 
										<p>
                     If we want to invest in the stock market, I thought it would be best to learn about how the market
		     works itself and the best way to do that is to learn about market structure. At its core, market
		     structure is about identifying whether a stock is going/trending up (bullish), down (barrish) or
		     moving sideways (consolidation). If the stock is in an uptrend, the price forms higher highs and 
		     higher lows. If the stock is in a downtrend, the price is in lower highs and lower lows. Support
		     is the price level where buyers tend to step in and push the price up. Alternatively, Resistance
		     is the price level where sellers step in and push the price down. One cool trick I learned is to
		     look left on a chart and see the previous turning points -- those often become the future support
		     or resistance level.
                                                                                </p>

												<h3>What I Practiced</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												I am trying out a new method of sharing information which is to tell you what I practiced and what I 
												learned from it. Here is what I did: I picked a few high performing stocks like Apple, Microsoft, etc.
												and I drew out their recent highs and lows. I used that to find and identify trends using basic price 
												action (analyzing basic price movement over time). I marked areas where the price has bounced or 
												changed multiple times (support) or where it was rejected (resistance)
											<p>
										</section>
										<section>
											<header>
												<h3>What I learned</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												 I learned that understanding market structure gives you context for everything. It makes volume and 
												 price action more meaningful because you get to see how buyers and sellers figher over certain price
												 zones and it shows how a stock grows over time. You can even use it to see if you should even be 
												 trading or not depending on the state of the market. 
                                                                                        </p>
											h2>Day 4: Chart Patterns </h2>
										</header> 
										<p>
                     Now that I know about how the market is structured, I think learning chart patterns and learning
		     how to anticipate potential moves is the best way forward. Chart patterns are repeated shapes 
		     show up when you use price action and it often shows what will happen next in the chart. 
                     These patterns are important because they reflect the psychology of buyers and sellers. Some
		     Some patterns signal that the trend is likely to continue while others suggest that the trend
		     will flip. Some continuation patterns include: Bull Flag (A sharp move up followed by a tight,
		     downward sloping-line moving sideways), Pennant (Price moves sideways into a small symmetrical
		     triangle after a strong move), and Ascending Triangle (Flat resistance at the rop with higher
		     lows forming underneath). Some reversal patterns include Double Top (Price hits the same high 
	             but fails to break through), Head and Shoulders (Three peaks with the middle one being the 
		     highest), and Cup and Handle (Rounded bottom followed by a small dip).
                                                                                </p>
										<section>
											<header>
												<h3>What I Practiced</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												So what I did was I scanned a few ETFs and stocks on TradingView and I started marking them to find any 
												patterns that I recognized. I started with bull flags and double tops and made my way to the other 
												patterns. I also checked to see if volume confirmed the pattern. 
											<p>
										</section>
										<section>
											<header>
												<h3>What I learned</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												 I learned that chart patterns dont guarantee anything but they give struture to where breakouts or 
												 breakdowns might occur. Combining this with understanding market strcture (Day 3) and volume (Day 2)
												 can make this so much more powerful. Think of this as a map for how prices might move next.
                                                                                        </p>
